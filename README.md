## MySQL_EmployeeTracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, my challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Using this application, the user is able to view employees, roles, departments, as well as a view a complete list of data from an employee including:
* first name
* last name
* department 
* role
* salary
* manager

This application can add roles, add departments, and add new employees.  

It uses node, mySQL, inquirer, and console table. 

It was a good challenge, I really enjoyed working with the databases through MySQL
